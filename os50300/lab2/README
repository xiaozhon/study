This file describes the configurations of two IPC methods: shared memory and unix socket.
For both methods, totally 5000000 messages are sent. Each message is a random integer in 
range [0, 511]. All methods are tested on Pegasus.

1. IPC using shared memory
	Source files are at folder shm/. Buffer size is 2048, implemented as ring buffer.
	
	The throughput is about 400,000 ~ 600,000 messages per second, depending on the 
	avaliable resources on pegasus.
	
	
2. IPC using unix socket
	Source files are at folder unixSocket/. 
	
	The throughput is about 120,000 ~ 200,000 messages per second.
