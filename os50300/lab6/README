Operating System Lab 6: Performance Measurement

# The test method follows those described in the lab assignment document.

# Files:
	papi_function_call.c
	papi_system_call.c
	papi_context_switch.c
	papi_page_fault.c
	Makefile
	Performance_result.pdf
	
# Test parameters:
	Function call: call a dummy function for	1000,000 times
	System call: call getpid() for				1000,000 times
	Context switch: send pipe messages for 		1000 	 times
		The number of context switches >=		2000	 times
	Page fault: read elements from large array	501		 times
		Create two arrays, the size of the array
		equals to the main memory size
		
# How to run:
 1.	Change these two lines in Makefile:
	
		LIBS = /home/xiaozhon/OS/papi/lib/libpapi.a
		INC  = -I/home/xiaozhon/OS/papi/include
	
	to corresponding path in your machine.
  
 2.	In terminal, type
	
		make
		
 3. Run each of the tests by typing:
 
		./function_call_test
		./system_call_test
		./context_switch_test
		./page_fault_test
		
	at the end of the test, time and cpu cycle usage information will be 
	printed to the screen.
	
	It will take a little longer to run "page_fault_test"
