- Hoffman compression and decompression: input is 1 GB text file based on ASCII encoding. 
  Performance is measured using the correctness and compression/decompression time. 
  
    Test environment: VirtualBox + Ubunti (4G virtual memory), i7-3250M
  
    Result: about 40 seconds to compress and 30 seconds to decompress
